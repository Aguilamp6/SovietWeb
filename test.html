    The Adventure Update was supposed to give us more motivation to explore, but instead the motivation was taken away.
    Here's why:

    Many of the features included in the 1.7.3 generator that brought the game to life were unexpectedly removed when
    1.8 hit our clients. Due to this, monstrous amounts of variety are now non-existent in Minecraft. Most of the
    problems with the generator today are due to limitation. With that being said, every seed is now basically
    identical, meaning there is WAY too much predictiveness in the terrain:


    LIMITED HEIGHT VARIATION

    Spoiler (click to show)
    For instance, we can only find mountains in the Extreme Hills (EH) biome and the X-hills biomes (ForestHills,
    DesertHills, etc.) In the EH biome, height changes are forced, ALWAYS leaving us with a sloppy mess of turquoise
    spam reaching to the heavens. In the X-hills biomes, the same thing happens, except height changes hardly ever reach
    "mountain level."

    So why is this bad? Although this brings us joyous mountains, they are never spread apart, or landlocked by flat
    land. Thus, if you find a mountain you are nearly 100% sure to find more and more. Also, when you see turquoise
    grass, you are 100% sure to find mountains. It's predictability at its greatest. This is bad because the pre-1.8
    generator contained more height variation. You could literally find any type of landscape. Just look at the variety
    of landscapes you could find in pre-1.8 in comparison to current generation:



    As you see from this picture, the only way to achieve max-height terrain is to visit the EH biome. No, X-hills will
    not allow you to do this. What we do know is that EH biomes and X-hills together give us a somewhat decent array of
    variation, but 1.7.3's array was a LOT bigger. Want proof?



    In this image, not only is there an overhang and a thin rocky formation, but there is flat land isolating both of
    these. There is no way to represent full random height variation in one picture, but this may give you a hint as to
    what it may be. What else can we bring to the plate?



    Beta 1.8+ babies may not know what this is. Here is a picture of the most popular seed before the terrain was
    ruined. Glacier was its name. Now, this isn't the best picture of the Glacier Mountains, but I will attempt to
    describe it. Imagine a seasonal forest with mountains sprawling across the whole biome. This may seem like the
    equivalent of today's ForestHills sub-biome but it is not! An area such as the Glacier Mountains was not something
    you would see every five minutes. It was found by seed-hunting -- another damaged factor due to the 1.8 terrain
    changes. Ladies and gentlefish, this seed may just describe what height variation is all about. You see, if you
    exited the area of the mountains, there'd be terrain nothing like it. You would see occasional hills and land easy
    to build on! And guess what? This all happened within biomes of the same name. There were no limitations nor
    restrictions.

    Now before you start replying (and I urge you not until reading ALL of this post), let me show you what the 1.7.3
    generator could do, even though people may think it wasn't possible.



    The picture above IS Beta-1.7.3 terrain, not Release-1.3.2. Yes, flat land was possible. REMEMBER, we are not asking
    for the previous generator! We want the current one improved so that everyone is happy!!!!



    FORCED ENDLESS CAVES

    Spoiler (click to show)
    Another flaw of the current generator is the underground generation. There are simply too many caves, and this
    problem is existent in every world, just like our height variation problem. Often, I find myself bored in-game,
    because within the first five minutes of a newly created world, I'm already set for life because I found a cave that
    extends on and on. Literally, we can now find stacks of iron ore and enough diamond to last us half a year within
    the first hour of gameplay!

    So why is this bad? It is understandable some people may like having extensive caves, as do I, but not all the time.
    Minecraft always needed more challenge, and this cave problem definitely worsens the issue. Back in pre-1.8, there
    were caves of varying sizes -- the same amount of variety that the mountains had. Now we are limited to seemingly
    endless tunnels and caverns. Don't you miss "conquering" a cave in less than 10 years? I know I do.

    Don't believe me? Look at this:



    You could say "that's just one area in one world." WRONG. Look at this:



    Want more?




    This is absurd. The people who enjoy extensive caves are sure happy, but the people who want caves of varying sizes
    should be enraged!




    SLOPPY SAND BEACHES & ABSENCE OF GRAVEL BEACHES

    Spoiler (click to show)
    Another problem with current terrain generation includes the formation of beaches and the absence of gravel beaches.
    Gravel beaches were an undeniably cool feature to pre-1.8 generation, and Mojang had no reason to remove them when
    the Adventure Update hit our clients. Remember the "404 Challenge?" Well now it's impossible to have anything merely
    resemble it (except for the extensive cave system, of course). Sandy beaches are now always sloppily generated,
    therefore lowering the rate of variety within every world.

    Why is this bad? It is obvious that the removal of gravel beaches upsets many people, as it does to me. Sandy
    beaches on the other hand definitely need work. Take a look at this current beach:



    ..Well that was awkward. The generator seems to just replace random coasts with sand blocks. Face it, pre-1.8 had
    things like this as well, maybe not as common, but definitely existent. However, pre-1.8 also had good looking
    beaches! This is what we call VARIETY -- when things stop reappearing over and over again.

    Ok, admitted, the picture above may be a little biased. Let's throw in a picture that an opposer gave to me:



    This is someone's example of a perfect beach. You've got to be kidding me. First off, two things need to be pointed
    about before getting into the specifics.

    1. This is set on the Large Biomes option. Good terrain should be available to those who play on the default
    setting!

    2. This "beach" is adjacent to a jungle biome. Beaches next to jungle biomes tend to look a bit nicer in comparison
    to those that are adjacent to other biomes. Therefore, this picture is a little biased itself.

    As said before, the main problem with today's beaches is that they are always going to have this form. Only one or
    two horizontal lines of sand are actually on sea-level. Again, we had crappy beaches and good beaches in 1.7.3 and
    this is good because of the variety it brought to the game. We all shouldn't be able to reach preffered terrain
    everywhere we go, right? That's the challenge and fun!

    Take a look at this picture of a pre-1.8 beach:



    Now that's what I call a good looking beach! Look how many consistent sand blocks are actually on sea-level. Compare
    that to the one or two lines of consistent sandy-coasts in current generation. Remember, pre-1.8 also had crappy
    beaches, which is a good thing because it distributed variety into every world.

    Keep in mind, this thread is NOT about the existence of oceans, the "RPG" features, the existence of the new world
    generation features, biome size, random placement of biomes, and possibly more. We also do not endorse the return of
    past generators or a new world option.
    If you want to discuss these said features, you are in the WRONG THREAD.


    WHY MODS ARE NOT THE SOLUTION:

    Quote from Shreaders Â»
    Mods are a temporary fix to a long-term problem. Most of the terrain altering mods out there do not even live up to
    the standards that are put forth in this thread. They all are attempts to bring back 1.7 map generation into the
    current terrain. If you're asking Isn't this what we want? No, and this means that you did not read the full thread.
    So please go back, re-read the thread, and then re-post.

    What we want done to the terrain is have it tweaked to add more height variety per biome. We want the structures and
    everything that was added since 1.8 except for the flat, dull, boring land. Mods do not fix this as they create ugly
    jumbled up and chewed up land masses all over the place (Which those types of land masses can also be neat if
    harnessed and used correctly by mojang.)
    Did not know that? Re-read the thread, and re-post.

    So for those of you who keep coming on here advertising different mods that we can use: 45 people have mentioned the
    same thing before you: so do not bother as it will not silence us. We feel the current map generation needs to be
    altered to satisfy all of Mojangs player base not just 25% (and yes those numbers are accurate .. the poll for this
    change is at 75% yes and 25% no) Did not know that? Simple.. Re-read the thread, and then re-post.

    Quotes From Different Players:

    Quote from Mattressi Â»

    I'm a little confused that this isn't a bigger complaint: I mean, swamps look ugly, sure and there are a few bugs
    here and there, but BIOMES ARE ABSOLUTELY RUINED. Seriously, I can't even play anymore - I'm just so bored by the
    landscape. I like mountains with trees (regular, pines and birch) and snow. I can have either mountains OR snow OR
    trees. Awesome -_-
    Seeds are completely pointless now - all they do is determine your spawn point. Might as well just use one seed and
    ask at the start if you want to start in the biome with trees, the biome with mountains or the other biomes with
    nothing in them.

    Has anyone tried tweeting jeb about this (I'm pretty sure Notch isn't working on Minecraft anymore)? To me, this is
    the single largest issue with Minecraft currently. Varied and crazy terrain was one of the greatest things about
    Minecraft pre-1.8. Now, Minecraft's terrain is more boring than in real life. Realism I could possibly stand (in a
    game with creepers and which originally became popular because of its crazy and interesting randomly generated
    terrain), but it simply isn't realistic to have no snow on any mountains, to have no trees (one tree per chunk
    doesn't count - I'm talking forests) anywhere where it snows, to have almost completely flat terrain everywhere
    except in one specific area which has huge mountains and nothing else.

    Some have said it's this way because of NPC villages - if that's the case, I'd much rather have no NPCs at all if it
    will bring back an interesting world.

    Please, can someone here who uses twitter contact jeb and link him to this thread or ask if he realises that
    Minecraft's terrain generation is horrible and boring now, and whether he intends to fix it? If Mojang think it's
    fine as it is and don't fix it, I honestly won't be playing anymore. Bring back variety and craziness or lose those
    of your customers who enjoyed (above ground) exploration, building in unique locations, searching for the best seed,
    admiring the views and even just doing other things in a world that didn't feel like a void.

    Quote from Strottinglemon Â»
    The problem I have with it is: EVERY. WORLD. LOOKS. EXACTLY. THE. SAME.

    Quote from Homem Pigman Â»
    Moving mountains to a single biome was simply the worst idea in all of gaming history. And even those look bland.I
    want the extremely random worlds that made Minecraft be awesome!

    Quote from Mamrok Â»
    The terrain is a lot LESS complex than it used to be. What made the old generator more complex is, that the
    physical terrain overlapped with all biomes, so that we had a lot of combinations. The biomes now are very homogenic
    and are seperated from each other with surgical cuts. 1000 blocks of flat forrest *poof* 1200 blocks of flat desert
    *poof* 1000 blocks of treeless extreme mountains *poof* 1000 blocks of flat forrest. very complex...

    Also the additon of ravines and rivers doesnt have anything to do with how the terrain and biomes are created. They
    are just superimposed over the landscape.

    Quote from giraffeartillery Â»
    This more realistic terrain generation is incredibly bland. Once you see one biome, you have basically seen them
    all.

    The old one was varied and the biome mixing created some nice landscapes. Also spawning on a beach made it feel like
    you washed up on the shores of a unknown land. I wouldn't mind some modifications to the underground how ever.

    Quote from Domino Â»
    The sizes are perfect, but they need more variety in each one.

    Quote from Flygonair Â»
    I was gonna post a hate comment, but once i looked at the screenshots i realised you were right! I haven't seen any
    awesome looking mountain formations since 1.0.0! All i've been seeing is the same old plains, swamps, and pine
    forests!

    Quote from MineCrak Â»
    I used to be ok with there being some caves, but now the entire damned underground is swiss-cheesed with them... Now
    I hate them.

    Perhaps the people who love the endless caves are playing the game in Peaceful or Creative mode. Caves are a whole
    different matter in Normal difficulty. They are constantly getting in the way of my mines and underground
    constructions.

    I would rather have fewer but more epic caves or actual caverns then an endless ant farm of caves everywhere I dig..

    Quote from xlea99 Â»
    I kind of used to hate people who said the terrain was boring... but it is REALLY flat. I guess I have to agree now.
    While I'm in love with oceans and mushroomlands and jungles, there is not as much interesting stuff in the world. I
    really wish that jeb would put back in what notch took out: Mountain landforms.

    By that I mean not a mountain biome, but allowing allowing mountains to spawn in any biome on their own. That was
    one reason that the 1.7.3 generator was so friggin amazing.

    If Jeb made it so that mountains could spawn in the same sort of way as lakes, then things would get a lot better.
    Then, mountains would be spawning in forests, giving us back that good-ole' tree filled mountain range we all love.
    It could spawn in Praries, to allow villages to be at the top of the world. It could spawn in deserts, to give us
    back those sand falls. They could spawn in oceans, so you could find just a random huge mountain in the ocean, kind
    of like a survival island. Heck, they could even spawn in swamps. Allowing for some pretty cool crap to happen.

    Also, Jeb needs to put back the gravel beaches. I loved the look of those, and they just made things look so good.

    Quote from Wiggycat314 Â»
    I have been a heavy Minecraft player since Alpha 1.2.0_02 when I first started playing. It wasn't the mining or the
    monsters that urged me to play; it was the sense of adventure. Most of the time, when I make a new world, I don't
    plan on building, I spend most of the time exploring the unknown and seeing what Minecraft has to throw at me.

    When the ability to use seeds came out in Beta 1.3, it was then that my sense of exploration really started to rise.
    So many words and letters to type, so many worlds, but so little time. I loved it, each world had it's own
    uniqueness to it. If you managed to find a very nice world, you knew that this world was yours and no one else had
    one like it (unless you shared the seed).

    When 1.8 came out, it really hit me hard. There was little to no variety in the worlds anymore. Seeds (in my
    opinion) were then obsolete. What's the point of sharing seeds when every world looks the same.

    Quote from Creative_Explorer Â»
    It is a fact that the terrain has less variety in it than before.

    Quote from Frogging101 Â»
    I don't know why, but there are way way way too many caves. I don't recall there being this many before 1.8. I like
    exploring caves, and it's cool to navigate the enormous mineshafts. But only to a certain point. After spending
    hours and hours in a seemingly endless cave system, it just gets boring and repetitive. The cave system that I've
    been in since I started this world 3 days ago is just way too big. I dug a staircase mine type thing for a bit, just
    to collect a few ores to get me started. Within about 5-10 minutes I found my self in a cave system. 3 days later,
    I'm still in the cave system. I've seen about 3 ravines, destroyed 2 cave spider spawners, gotten lost in 2
    different abandoned mineshafts and maybe 20 different caverns. I have half a chest full of coal, and the other half
    is iron, gold and a few diamonds.IT NEVER ENDS.

    Quote from Owl Exterminator Â»
    I love enchanting, I love the new biomes, I love all of the new features, and there isn't one I would ever want
    removed from the game. I miss the old world though. The new world isn't the same, it doesn't even compare. I'm sorry
    to all those people I insulted back when the adventure update went live. I'm sorry because I know why you were
    upset.
    Quote from DrakBadgerwaffles Â»
    I wouldn't be against Mojang hiring a guy on full time to do nothing but work on the terrain, as long as it gets
    done.

    Also, is the Bukkit team actually still part of Mojang? I thought they were hired on and since then I've heard very
    little out of the progress they are supposed to be making.

    Here's a rundown of how I think they are splitting their efforts. I'm thinking Bukkit got there, wanted to finish
    working on the Mod API, opened up the core program and realize that it was just a bunch of empty classes that would
    require a ton more time than they figured. Then 1.4 was held back to compensate.

    Meanwhile, Jeb and Dinnerbone get to work on RPG stuff because Dinnerbone really only knows how to work with
    entities and Jeb is really only good at picking up the slack that Notch created when he would have his brain-farts
    so infrequently since the beginning of 1.8pre.

    Then Notch leaves after delivering terrain so uninspired that he forgot to add roses, snow, and mountains (Really!?
    How can some people think current gen is better than 1.7.3 when it didn't even launch with ROSES and SNOW!?), Jeb
    takes up the torch of the entire game, makes beaches and X-hills their own biomes because he has no idea what mess
    of cobwebs Notch put up, and here we are with vertical beaches, endless biomes of flat terrain, and mountains that
    are so forced that even their heights are the same...

    And some people still think 1.8 and up is better than 1.7.3? The development process alone is horrible enough to be
    deal-breaker.
    Quote from xBella Â»
    Gah. I honestly can't stand the 1.3.2 terrain generation at all anymore. If I play singleplayer, it's always with my
    1.7.3 .jar because it's just an eyesore to look at the current terrain generation. The terrain of 1.7.3 makes it
    seem like a whole new game. Honestly, I love jungles and swamps but I would trade it and NPC villages for the 1.7.3
    terrain. That doesn't mean I want Jeb to just re-add 1.7.3 terrain and dump jungles and swamps, I just want him to
    improve it.
    What happened to the savannahs? It bugs me so much to see a desert next to a jungle. I don't even know why they
    removed the temperature system. I miss the beaches and the gravel beaches that were everywhere. Beach houses were
    possible back then. If you wanted a proper beach house now, you'd have to have a tiny 2x2 house just to fit it in
    the beach. It also annoys me a lot when people tell me to use Large Biomes if I want better beaches. Why should I
    have to use Large Biomes to enjoy a feature that was once perfect? We don't need the 1.7.3 terrain generator back,
    we need the current one improved.
